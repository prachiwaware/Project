			<h2><u>Kokankada Camping</u></h2>

				Fascinating trek to Harishchandragad via Pachnai and Camping on Konkan Kada.<br>
				This fort is famous amongst Pune and Mumbai trekking groups. There are 3 peaks i.e. Rohidas, Taramati, and Harishchandra. Taramati peak is the highest one in the fort. Harishchandra fort is a must trekking destination for camping near konkan kada.<br>
				The Kokankada cliff is the major attraction of Harishchandragad. This cliff is not only vertical but also over-hanged like a hood of a cobra. This nature architecture is beyond description. And you can experience the chilling weather and cool breeze in the night while camping. Camping is always fun seating besides camp fire in Chilling weather and enjoying the peace of nature. What if camp site will be Konkankada-Harishchandragad at 3500 Feet. Yes we going to do camping at cliff of “Konkan Kada “ 3500 Feet above from sea level which is 2-3 hrs trek from Pachnai route.<br>
				The temple Harishchandreshwar is marvelous example of the fine art of carving sculptures out of stones that prevailed in ancient India. It is about 16 m high from its base. Around this temple there a few caves & ancient water tanks. The river Mangal Ganga is said to originate from one of the tanks located close to the temple. The top of the temple resembles construction with the north-Indian temples. A similar temple is situated in Buddha-Gaya. Here we can see many tombs, in which a typical construction is seen.<br>
				These are built by well-finished arranging stones one on top of the other. There are three main caves near the temple. The cisterns near the temple provide drinking water. A short distance away, another temple called Kashitirtha is located. The fascinating thing about this temple is that it has been carved out from a single huge rock. There are entrances from all four sides. On the main entrance there are sculptures of faces. These are faces of guards of the temple. On the left side of the entrance is a Devsnagsri inscription, which is about saint Changdev.
