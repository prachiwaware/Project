		<h1>Listening to Developer Feedback to Improve Google Play</h1>

			Developers are our partners and by pairing their creativity and innovation with our platforms and tools, together we create delightful experiences for billions of people around the world. Listening carefully to their feedback is an important part of how we continue to make Android better with each release and improve how mobile app stores work. In an April 2019 blog post we shared some updates we made to Android APIs and Play Policies based on developer feedback. And today, we wanted to share some additional insights we’ve gained from developer feedback and how we’re taking that input to improve Google Play and Android. Some of the key themes we’ve heard include:<br>
			1.Supporting developers’ ability to choose how they distribute their apps through multiple app stores on different platforms (mobile, PC, and console), each with their own business model competing in a healthy marketplace;<br>
			2.Clarifying our policies regarding who needs to use Google Play’s billing system and who does not;<br>
			3.Ensuring equal treatment for all apps, including first-party and third-party apps, on our platforms;<br>
			4.Allowing developers to connect and communicate directly with their customers;<br>
			Enabling innovation and ensuring our policies embrace new technologies that can help drive the consumer experience forward.<br>
			We’d like to share our perspective on each of these points.
			<h2>Choice of stores</h2>
			We believe that developers should have a choice in how they distribute their apps and that stores should compete for the consumer’s and the developer’s business. Choice has always been a core tenet of Android, and it’s why consumers have always had control over which apps they use, be it their keyboard, messaging app, phone dialer, or app store.<br>
			Android has always allowed people to get apps from multiple app stores. In fact, most Android devices ship with at least two app stores preinstalled, and consumers are able to install additional app stores. Each store is able to decide its own business model and consumer features. This openness means that even if a developer and Google do not agree on business terms the developer can still distribute on the Android platform. This is why Fortnite, for example, is available directly from Epic's store or from other app stores including Samsung's Galaxy App store.<br>
			That said, some developers have given us feedback on how we can make the user experience for installing another app store on their device even better. In response to that feedback, we will be making changes in Android 12 (next year’s Android release) to make it even easier for people to use other app stores on their devices while being careful not to compromise the safety measures Android has in place. We are designing all this now and look forward to sharing more in the future!<br>
			<h2>Clarity on billing policies</h2>
			As we mentioned, each Android app store is able to decide its own business model and consumer features. For Google Play, users expect a safe, secure and seamless experience, and developers come to Play for powerful tools and services that help them build and grow their businesses. Our developer policies are designed to help us deliver on these expectations and Google Play's billing system is a cornerstone of our ongoing commitment. Consumers get the benefit of a trusted system that allows them to safely, securely, and seamlessly buy from developers worldwide. Google protects consumers’ payment info with multiple layers of security, using one of the world’s most advanced security infrastructures. For developers, Google Play’s billing system provides an easy way for billions of Android users to transact with them using their local, preferred method of payment.<br>
			We’ve always required developers who distribute their apps on Play to use Google Play’s billing system if they offer in-app purchases of digital goods, and pay a service fee from a percentage of the purchase. To be clear, this policy is only applicable to less than 3% of developers with apps on Google Play. We only collect a service fee if the developer charges users to download their app or they sell in-app digital items, and we think that is fair. Not only does this approach allow us to continuously reinvest in the platform, this business model aligns our success directly with the success of developers.<br>
			But we have heard feedback that our policy language could be more clear regarding which types of transactions require the use of Google Play’s billing system, and that the current language was causing confusion. We want to be sure our policies are clear and up to date so they can be applied consistently and fairly to all developers, and so we have clarified the language in our Payments Policy to be more explicit that all developers selling digital goods in their apps are required to use Google Play’s billing system.
			<h2>Equal treatment</h2>
			Our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including Google’s own apps. We use the same standards to decide which apps to promote on Google Play, whether they're third-party apps or our own apps. In fact, we regularly promote apps by Google’s competitors in our Editors Choice picks when they provide a great user experience. Similarly, our algorithms rank third-party apps and games using the same criteria as for ranking Google's own apps.
			<h2>Communicating with customers</h2>
			Developers have told us it is very important to be able to speak directly with their customers without significant restrictions. As app developers ourselves, we agree wholeheartedly and our policies have always allowed this.<br>
			That said, developers have asked whether they can communicate with their customers directly about pricing, offers, and alternative ways to pay beyond their app via email or other channels. To clarify, Google Play does not have any limitations here on this kind of communication outside of a developer’s app. For example, they might have an offering on another Android app store or through their website at a lower cost than on Google Play.<br>
			We understand the importance of maintaining the customer relationship. As such, we have also always allowed developers to issue refunds to their customers and provide other customer support directly.

		<strong>64 new variants of 'Joker' malware have invaded Android app stores</strong><br>
		<em>By Cohen Coberly on September 29, 2020, 5:22 PM </em>
		<p>
			In context: Malicious Android apps are nothing new, even on the supposedly well-curated Google Play Store. Indeed, just a couple of days ago, Google was forced to remove 17 Android apps that contained a malware family known as "Joker." Joker-laden apps masquerade as legitimate and may even provide useful functions to their users -- however, some time after the app has been downloaded onto a given device, its true, sinister goal is achieved.<br>
			According to Zscaler, the 17 apps involved in the latest Google crackdown were downloaded a whopping 120,000 times in total. That's 120,000 potential victims, and the problem is only getting worse: new reports suggest 64 new Joker variants have already been discovered in just the past couple of weeks.<br>
			First, the app "decodes" or decrypts strings to obtain and load a URL to a malicious "dex" file. Then, the dex file is downloaded from said URL, and it's loaded onto the system using "reflection techniques" that invoke the "DexClassLoader constructor." Finally, the file performs whatever malicious tasks it was developed to do, with the device owner often being none the wiser.<br>
			It will be difficult for Google to keep a handle on this massive influx of sophisticated, virus-laden apps, but we'll let you know if the problem gets worse or improves over the coming months.<br>
			In the meantime, Android should only download apps from developers they fully trust and avoid leaving unused apps on their phones without good reason.

		<strong>Bing and other smaller search providers win Google's latest Android choice screen auction</strong><br>
		<em>By Adrian Potoroaca on September 29, 2020, 4:08 PM</em>
		<p>
			The big picture: Google's latest Android "choice screen" auction results saw Microsoft's Bing win in all the major markets in Europe, alongside three other search engines from small independent providers. But while it may look like the search giant has done the right thing after being fined $5 billion for anticompetitive behavior, some of its rivals think the auction is designed to prevent Google from bleeding market share.<br>
			Last year, Google promised it would soon let Android users choose an alternative search engine to govern their smartphones. The company devised a country-specific auction where alternative search providers could bid for one of three slots alongside Google in a choice screen shown during device setup.<br>
			The results for the October-December auction are in, and it looks like the big winners are Bing, GMX, Info.com, and PrivacyWall -- these will show up for a majority of the countries in Europe, including major markets like Germany, France, and the UK. By contrast, DuckDuckGo and Yandex only won in a few of the smaller countries, despite the former managing to win in all 31 countries in the first auction earlier this year.<br>
			Google says that "in developing the choice screen for Europe, we carefully balanced providing users with yet more choice while ensuring that we can continue to invest in developing and maintaining the open-source Android platform for the long-term. [...] An auction is a fair and objective method to determine which search providers are included."<br>
			Naturally, rival search providers disagree. DuckDuckGo believes the auctions are rigged by Google to ensure continued dominance of its own search engine. DuckDuckGo CEO and founder Gabriel Weinberg says that his search engine didn't win in more countries because search providers are incentivized to bid close to what they can expect to earn in profit for every user they gain.<br>
			Weinberg notes that while DuckDuckGo has been "robustly profitable" since 2014, the focus on user privacy and a clean search experience translates into a lot less profit per search. This results in a lower bid in Google's auction, where some rival search engines with less strict privacy policies and more aggressive advertising strategies stand to win.
