			<h2>William Shakespeare</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<q>1.What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.</q><br>
				<q>2.There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.</q><br>
				<q>3.There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.</q>
